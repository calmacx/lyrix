# Lyrix

A python module for searching for lyrics and analysing lyrics of given artist(s).

Lyrix can be imported as a python class to more control, or the Command Line Interface (CLI) can be used.

Lyrix used the Spotify API as a backend to retrieve songs of a given artist.

Follow this README for a guide on how to use the CLI, for the python module - follow the `jupyter` notebook [provided here](https://github.com/calmacx/lyrix/blob/master/notebooks/Analysis.ipynb).

## Installation

Get the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/calmacx/lyrix.git
```

Setup a virtual environment (optional, otherwise used python `>=3.8`)
```
python3 -m venv .
source bin/activate
```

Install the cloned folder from git:
```
pip install pip --upgrade
pip install -e ./lyrix
```

## Setup Env file

To be able to use this package with the SpotifyAPI, you will need to set the following variables in a `.env` file where the code/CLI is executed from.
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
SPOTIFY_AUTH_URL = 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token'
SPOTIFY_API_URL = 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/'
```

You will need a Spotify developer account (free), instruction for setting this up and obtaining a client ID and secret [can be found here.](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/).

If you do not, you will see the error:
```
Exception: One or more of ['SPOTIFY_API_URL', 'SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID', 'SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET', 'SPOTIFY_AUTH_URL'] is not in a .env file
```
